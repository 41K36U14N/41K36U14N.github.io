# Who am I? 

Hey there!

I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. I've always been passionate about learning and challenging myself, whether it's through my studies, work experiences, or hobbies. 

Currently, I'm a student at the **Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media**, where I'm constantly exploring new concepts and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve. By day, you'll find me at the energy station Circle K, where I wear multiple hats as an employee and trustee. As a union representative, I advocate for my colleagues' rights and ensure that their voices are heard in matters ranging from general working conditions to individual disputes. It's a role that's taught me invaluable lessons in communication, conflict resolution, and advocacy.

But that's not all—I'm deeply involved in my community as well. As the Chairman of the Board for Wake Me Up Lorenskog and have some experiance as a Marketing Manager for Garn med Mening, I'm dedicated to promoting mental health awareness and providing support for young adults. In these roles, I oversee organizational operations, manage finances, and lead a passionate team towards our common goals.

On top of all that, I'm also a published author! My book, 'Self - you before the World,' delves into the journey of self-development and empowerment, challenging societal norms and encouraging readers to reclaim their power. And if that's not exciting enough, I'm currently working on a fantasy trilogy book series set to release in 2030- yeah, i know its a long time till you will be reading my book, but it takes time to perfect the perfect fantasy world.

When it comes to skills, I bring a diverse range to the table—from creativity and writing prowess to leadership and strategic planning. I thrive in dynamic environments, leveraging my adaptability and problem-solving abilities to drive success.

In my downtime, you'll often find me immersed in gaming, whipping up delicious treats in the kitchen, or indulging in some fun DIY projects. Oh, and I'm a huge fan of re-bingeing 'The Big Bang Theory'—who isn't, right?

I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities together. Let's chat!

> ps: One thing you are going to notice with my blog posts, is that I use lots of different analogies, mainly because thats how I learn best and take my notes. 
Another reason to why I do this is because, in the tech world; you have to be able to teach or show people the hows, the whens, the wheres ect to non-technical people, and I find that people have a better understanding to things when it is more relatable to 'the norm'. 
So buckle up for many analogies in baking, gym, gaming, farming and DIY's, since those are my hobbies hahaha 😆
