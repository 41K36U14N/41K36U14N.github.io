## Introduction to Windows Server Operating System:
- The Windows Server Operating System is a powerful platform designed by Microsoft specifically for running server applications and services.
- Unlike client or workstation operating systems like Windows 10, which are optimized for individual user productivity, Windows Server is tailored for tasks such as hosting websites, managing databases, and providing network services.


Windows' history began with Microsoft's MS-DOS, developed for IBM personal computers. Released in 1981, it was controlled using text commands and the command-line interface before the Windows GUI.
In 1985, Microsoft introduced Windows 1.0, a GUI-based OS that evolved into the robust Windows OS, with Windows Server 2019 and 2022 versions being the foundation for the Windows Server family.

**Understanding Licensing Modes:**
- Windows Server offers several licensing modes, each with its own set of features and pricing options.
- Common licensing modes include:
  - Per Core: This mode licenses the server based on the number of processor cores it has.
  - Per Server: This mode licenses the server based on the number of physical servers being used.
  - CAL (Client Access License): This mode licenses the server based on the number of users or devices accessing it.

**Approaches to Installing Windows on a Computer:**
- There are various approaches to installing Windows on a computer, including:
  - Clean Install: This involves installing Windows on a new or formatted hard drive, erasing any existing data.
  - Upgrade Install: This involves upgrading an existing version of Windows to a newer version while preserving files, settings, and applications.
  - Dual Boot: This involves installing multiple operating systems on the same computer, allowing you to choose which one to boot into at startup.

**Differences Between Client/Workstation and Server Operating Systems:**
- Client or workstation operating systems, such as Windows 10, are designed for individual users and focus on tasks like web browsing, document editing, and multimedia playback.
- Server operating systems, like Windows Server, are optimized for running server applications and services, such as web servers, email servers, and domain controllers.
- Server operating systems typically have features like enhanced security, centralized management tools, and support for higher hardware specifications compared to client operating systems.
